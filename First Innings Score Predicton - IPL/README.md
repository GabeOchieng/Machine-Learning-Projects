### Problem statement:
Build a model to predict the score (in terms of range) of any IPL match.

### Dataset:
The dataset _'ipl.csv'_ consists of ball-to-ball informations about every match of IPL from __Season 1 to 10__ ie: (2008 to 2017)
Dataset consists following columns:
_• mid: Unique match id._
_• date: Date on which the match was played._
_• venue: Stadium where match was played._
_• bat_team: Batting team name._
_• bowl_team: Bowling team name._
_• batsman: Batsman who faced that particular ball._
_• bowler: Bowler who bowled that particular ball._
_• runs: Runs scored by team till that point of instance._
_• wickets: Number of Wickets fallen of the team till that point of instance._
_• overs: Number of Overs bowled till that point of instance._
_• runs_last_5: Runs scored in previous 5 overs._
_• wickets_last_5: Number of Wickets that fell in previous 5 overs._
_• striker: max(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)._
_• non-striker: min(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)._
_• total: Total runs scored by batting team at the end of first innings._

### Dependencies:
_• Python - 3.6_
_• Scikit-Learn_
_• Pandas_
_• Numpy_
_• Matplotlib_
_• Seaborn_
_• Google Colaboratory_

### Algorithms Used:
_• Linear Regression_
_• Decision Tree Regression_
_• Random Forest Regression_
_• Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) Algorithm_

# Future Scope:
_• Add columns in dataset of top batsmen and bowlers of all the teams._
_• Add columns that consists of striker and non-striker's strike rates._
_• Implement this problem statement using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)._
